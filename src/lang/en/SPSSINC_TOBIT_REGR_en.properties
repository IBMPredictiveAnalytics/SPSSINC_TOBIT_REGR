Description=This procedure estimates a regression model where the dependent variable has a fixed lower bound, upper bound, or both. It can be thought of as a combination of a probit model with a linear regression model. You can specify the distribution assumed for the dependent variable, and you can save the residuals from the regression as well as the estimated coefficients. The procedure uses the tobit function from the R AER package.
Summary=Estimate a regression model whose dependent variable has a fixed lower bound, upper bound, or both.
