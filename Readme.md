# SPSSINC TOBIT REGR
## Estimate a regression model whose dependent variable has a fixed lower bound, upper bound, or both.
 This procedure estimates a regression model where the dependent variable has a fixed lower bound, upper bound, or both. It can be thought of as a combination of a probit model with a linear regression model. You can specify the distribution assumed for the dependent variable, and you can save the residuals from the regression as well as the estimated coefficients.
